# Machine Learning with Andrew Ng

Programming assignments that I implemented in python of [Coursera's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (it uses Octave/MATLAB). I also added some concepts and formulas that I think are useful to help to understand the algorithms.

In order to have a nice visualization of the concepts, formulas, codes and exercises, I did all the implementations in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
